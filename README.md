# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot 
This is a small sample mini-project developed. This is completly written in C language 

Tech Stack: 
C 

Functions: 

1)Rand() -> Generate a Randomized number which we manipulated and produced in a limit by a mathematical equation  

2)Maintained a 2-D array data of both user and computer parallely to check for patterns and printing the required output  

3)Writen pattern checking Logic to check if the user tires to match a pattern blocks the matching block. 

4)This is a beginner level program and is not 100% effecient. Bot too loses the game if the user uses some of the patterns

5)For rand() function we use time.h header file thus random functions are generated according to the current time


In this way both user and computer puts therir respective choices and we finally get the resulting winner by checking if any pattern in found winning.

Thank You...
